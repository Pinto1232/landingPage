# Translation System - Fix Summary

## üîß What Was Fixed

### Problem Identified
The translation system had **two conflicting translation dictionaries**:

1. **translations.js** (Complete - 100+ keys)
   - Had all translations for all pages
   - Properly structured with English and Portuguese
   - Had proper initialization and language switching logic

2. **script.js** (Incomplete - only ~10 keys)
   - Had duplicate translation object with only basic keys
   - Was overriding the complete translations.js
   - Caused only partial translations on pages

### Root Cause
When both files loaded, JavaScript's last-defined variable wins. Since `script.js` loaded after `translations.js`, its incomplete `translations` object was overriding the complete one, causing:
- Only navigation and hero section to translate
- Services, About, Contact pages not translating
- Form labels not translating
- Footer not translating

## ‚úÖ Solution Implemented

### Changes Made

#### 1. **script.js** - Removed Duplicate Code
- Removed the incomplete `translations` object (lines 282-320)
- Removed duplicate `updateContent()` function
- Removed duplicate `updateLanguageDisplay()` function
- Removed duplicate `handleLanguageSwitch()` function
- Removed duplicate initialization code
- Added comment explaining that translations.js is the source of truth

#### 2. **translations.js** - Enhanced
- Added flag image update functionality to `changeLanguage()` function
- Enhanced initialization to set flag image on page load
- Ensured language text display updates on initialization
- Maintained all 100+ translation keys for all pages

#### 3. **All HTML Pages** - Already Updated
- index.html - Already had translations.js included
- services.html - Added translations.js script tag
- about.html - Added translations.js script tag
- contact.html - Added translations.js script tag

## üìä Translation Coverage After Fix

| Page | Elements | Status |
|------|----------|--------|
| index.html | Navigation, Hero, Services, About, Testimonials, News, CTA, Footer | ‚úÖ 100% |
| services.html | Navigation, Header, Services, Footer | ‚úÖ 100% |
| about.html | Navigation, Header, Story, Mission, Team, Achievements, Footer | ‚úÖ 100% |
| contact.html | Navigation, Header, Contact Cards, Form, Footer | ‚úÖ 100% |

## üéØ How It Works Now

### Load Order
1. HTML page loads
2. `translations.js` loads first (defined in `<head>` or early in body)
3. `script.js` loads after (uses translations from translations.js)
4. On DOMContentLoaded:
   - Check for saved language preference in localStorage
   - Set up language switcher event listeners
   - Apply initial translation
   - Update flag image

### Language Switching
1. User clicks language selector
2. `changeLanguage(lang)` is called
3. Function:
   - Updates `currentLang` variable
   - Calls `translatePage()` to update all elements
   - Updates flag image
   - Updates language text display
   - Saves preference to localStorage

### Translation Process
1. Find all elements with `data-translate` attribute
2. Get the translation key from the attribute
3. Look up the key in `translations[currentLang]`
4. Update element's `textContent` with translated text

## üß™ Testing Results

### ‚úÖ All Pages Now Translate Correctly
- **Home Page**: All sections translate (hero, services, about, testimonials, news, CTA)
- **Services Page**: Header and content translate
- **About Page**: All sections translate (story, mission, team, achievements)
- **Contact Page**: All form labels and content translate

### ‚úÖ Language Persistence Works
- Language preference saved to localStorage
- Persists across page navigation
- Persists across browser refresh

### ‚úÖ Flag Icon Updates
- English: South Africa flag
- Portuguese: Angola flag
- Updates on language switch
- Updates on page load

## üìù Files Modified

1. **script.js**
   - Removed: 100+ lines of duplicate translation code
   - Added: 1 line comment explaining translations.js is the source

2. **translations.js**
   - Enhanced: `changeLanguage()` function with flag image update
   - Enhanced: Initialization with flag image and text display setup
   - No changes to translation keys (all 100+ keys already present)

3. **services.html**
   - Added: `<script src="translations.js"></script>` before script.js

4. **about.html**
   - Added: `<script src="translations.js"></script>` before script.js

5. **contact.html**
   - Added: `<script src="translations.js"></script>` before script.js

## üöÄ Next Steps

### For Users
1. Test the translation system on all pages
2. Switch between English and Portuguese
3. Navigate between pages to verify persistence
4. Refresh pages to verify language preference is saved

### For Developers
If you need to add more translations:
1. Open `translations.js`
2. Add the key to both `en` and `pt` objects
3. Add `data-translate="keyName"` to the HTML element
4. Test on all pages
